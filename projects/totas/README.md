Theft of the Ambrosian Saffron is an AI-powered, chat-based detective game where players take on the role of an investigator solving a mysterious artifact theft. The game features dynamic conversations with suspects, branching narratives, and an adaptive story engine that responds to player choices in real time. Designed to blend natural language interaction with classic detective mechanics, it challenges players to uncover hidden motives and inconsistencies through dialogue alone. Developed as part of a university project, this game was built in a small team of three, with responsibilities shared across game design, AI integration, and narrative development.
