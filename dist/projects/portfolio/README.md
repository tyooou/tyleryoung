A personal portfolio inspired by the simplicity of the command line—minimal, fast, and focused. Built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience without the clutter. It features responsive design, intuitive navigation, and subtle interactivity. Visitors can explore my work, check in on friends I collaborate with, browse contact details, and switch between themes that suit their vibe. It’s professional without being sterile, playful without being loud, and above all, designed to stay out of the way while you look around.
