PixAI is a web app that turns your everyday images into retro masterpieces â€” think AI meets 8-bit nostalgia. Upload any photo, choose your pixelation vibe, and watch as smart algorithms crunch the details into crisp, charming pixel art. With real-time previews, customizable resolution sliders, and instant downloads, PixAI makes turning pixels into poetry as easy as drag, tweak, and save.
